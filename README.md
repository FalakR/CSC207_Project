## Project Overview

Project Domain : Food Delivery and Real-time Tracking

The Scoops Ahoy Food Delivery App is a comprehensive solution designed for "Scoops Ahoy," a local ice cream shop, to streamline their food delivery operations and enhance the overall customer experience. This project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly mobile application for both customers and delivery personnel. The app, allows users to log in or sign up easily. Users can browse a menu catalogue, add or remove items from their shopping cart, and view their cart contents anytime. They can place orders, track real-time delivery progress on a map, and receive alerts when their delivery is near. 


## API Documentation

To achieve real-time tracking and efficient order management, we plan to integrate with a third-party API for mapping and tracking. We are considering using the Google Maps API for this purpose. Below is the link to the Google Maps API documentation:


[Google Maps Platform Documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation)
[Ably Documentation](https://ably.com/docs/getting-started/setup?lang=java)


## Usage


Here is a screenshot of using the Google Maps API, by giving University of Toronto as address. This is an example output of running our Java code.
